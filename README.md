# Cryptography-Steganography

Overall, our project is implemented on two level security
  1. At the first level we used steganography and to enhance security  more, we pushed the result of the steganography to AES algorithm  and received the overall cipher text.
  2. We have analyzed various implementation correlation parameters at  the second level of security in our project to compare the parameter  results between AES and DES and concluded that AES is best among  them to provide second level of security before sending the cipher text  to receiver.
